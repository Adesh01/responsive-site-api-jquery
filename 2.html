                              A group of miners in Canada accidentally stumbled upon what is possibly the most intact dinosaur carcass science has ever seen. They discovered the fully-preserved nodosaur, a herbivore that stretched 18-feet-long and weighed nearly 3,000 pounds, in 2011 while working on a project 17 miles north of Alberta, Canada. Even though the dinosaur died over 110 million years ago, scientists say because they were preserved in just the right conditions, the remains appear to be only a few weeks old. <a href="#">read more</a>

                              When disaster strikes, whether it be man-made or natural, power is the resource people need most. For this reason, Professor Paul Dastoor has been working for decades to develop a lightweight “printed solar” panel that is capable of generating power. Now, the invention is in its final trial stages at the University of Newcastle in New South Wales. <a href="#">read more</a>

                              Over 7.5 billion people now reside on planet Earth, according to the World Population Clock. But with more people could comes less access to resources like food and energy. A global population of 7.5 billion people has far-reaching repercussions – including increased greenhouse gas emissions, strained food supplies, and increased total consumption, according to Charity organization Population Matters. <a href="#">read more</a>

                             Wherever it goes, TRASHPRESSO takes local waste and recycles it into tiles for use in architecture. The mobile recycling plant is in a 40-foot container platform that a trailer truck can transport, and Miniwiz says the plant opens up similar to how a satellite unpacks in orbit. It can recycle plastic and fabric waste, running on solar power. Garbage is “washed, shredded, melted, and molded” into architectural tiles, and the water to clean the trash is reused in the process.<br>The off-grid plant can pump out 10 square meters, or over 107 square feet, of the architectural tiles every 40 minutes. Each tile contains the equivalent of five plastic PET bottles. They can be utilized for exterior or interior floor finishes, according to Miniwiz, “or sold as raw material for further upcycling manufacturing processes like yarning, injection, and extrusion.” <a href="#">read more</a></div>

                              Remember when carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere hit a terrifying 400 parts per million (ppm)? That's number's old news now – concentrations just reached 410 ppm for the first time in millions of years. Last week, researchers at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii recorded the record-breaking level, and scientists warn the rate of increase will only slow when we reduce our carbon emissions. <a href="#">read more</a>

                              Grid-scale batteries could fill those supply gaps, but they’re still expensive and have not yet been widely deployed. Peakers, or turbines burning natural gas, offered a flawed answer; they take several minutes to get going so operators had to run them at minimum load even when they weren’t needed, generating greenhouse gas emissions. GE’s hybrid system combines peakers and batteries for a more environmentally friendly option. <a href="#">read more</a>

                              Federica Bertocchini, a scientist at the Institute of Biomedicine and Biotechnology of Cantabria, first uncovered the worm’s unique abilities by chance, when she attempted to clean up a wax worm infestation in one of her home beehives. She placed the worms in a plastic bag, tied it off, and left it in her house – only to find that the worms had chewed through the plastic and escaped.<br>She describes how 100 of the worms can chew through an ordinary polyethylene shopping bag in 40 minutes. At first, Bertocchini and her colleagues assumed the worms might be simply chewing through the plastic and shredding it. <a href="#">read more</a>
